all.

It wouldn't be game recommendation list from me if I did not mention my all-time favourite game. It's a puzzle adventure
that really makes you think out of literal box. Music, story and environments bring out a melancholic atmosphere that
you will remember for a long time.

That is it for now! As the previous post, I will keep this updated as I find more games that I think are worth playing.
