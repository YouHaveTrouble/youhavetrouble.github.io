    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Pawe≈Ç</strong>, but I'm better known as <strong>YouHaveTrouble</strong> on the internet.</p>
    <p>
      I currently work as a full-stack web developer. Technologies I usually use for my job are javascript, vuejs,
      typescript, sql. I also often actively research and learn about new technologies that could be used to improve my
      work.

      In my spare time I develop plugins for minecraft servers. This is a hobby that initially made me learn how to
      code. To this day I help maintain <a href="https://purpurmc.org">Purpur</a> server software along with its
      <a href="https://modrinth.com/plugin/purpurextras">official plugin</a>. List of plugins I currently support can be
      found <a href="https://modrinth.com/user/YouHaveTrouble/plugins">here</a>.

      My video game interests are mostly focused on narrative heavy games, but I also enjoy some ARPGs and roguelikes.
